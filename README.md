# Easy Album Cover

Show album cover image on button click!

## What it does & How to use it

1. Go to a supporting music site's album page or track page. For example, [this itunes page](https://music.apple.com/us/album/red-diary-page-1-ep/1290728246).
2. Click addon button -- a cute watermelon icon. A new tab should open on click and there you have the album image with highest resolution.
3. You are quite welcome.
